# replace-script

This repository contains two scripts: 'replace' and 'run-test'.

The 'replace'  script searches for files and directories in a given path and replaces any occurence of 'oldpattern' with 'newpattern' in both files and file contents.

The 'run-test' script creates and delates a directory structure used for testing the 'replace' script.
